-a    show targets that are alive
-A    show targets by address
-b n  amount of ping data to send, in bytes (default 56)
-B f  set exponential backoff factor to f
-c n  count of pings to send to each target (default 1)
-C n  same as -c, report results in verbose format
-D    print timestamp before each output line
-e    show elapsed time on return packets
-f    file read list of targets from a file ( - means stdin) (only if no -g specified)
-g    generate target list (only if no -f specified)
         (specify the start and end IP in the target list, or supply a IP netmask)
         (ex. fping -g 192.168.1.0 192.168.1.255 or fping -g 192.168.1.0/24)
-H n  Set the IP TTL value (Time To Live hops)
-i n  interval between sending ping packets (in millisec) (default 25)
-l    loop sending pings forever
-m    ping multiple interfaces on target host
-n    show targets by name (-d is equivalent)
-p n  interval between ping packets to one target (in millisec)
         (in looping and counting modes, default 1000)
-q    quiet (don't show per-target/per-ping results)
-Q n  same as -q, but show summary every n seconds
-r n  number of retries (default 3)
-s    print final stats
-I    if bind to a particular interface
-S    addr set source address
-t n  individual target initial timeout (in millisec) (default 500)
-T n  ignored (for compatibility with fping 2.4)
-u    show targets that are unreachable
-O n  set the type of service (tos) flag on the ICMP packets
-v    show version

To test multiple sites, use the following command –

$ fping www.tutorialspoint.com www.google.com
The sample output should be like this –

www.tutorialspoint.com is alive
www.google.com is alive
If host list are stored in a file, use the following command –

$ fping < hosts.txt
The sample output should be like this –

www.tutorialspoint.com is alive
www.google.com is alive
