Introduction to Cewl
CeWL, a custom wordlist generator written in Ruby, is designed to extract keywords from a specified URL to a given depth. These keywords serve as potential entries for password-cracking tools such as John the Ripper, Medusa, and WFuzz.

Additionally, CeWL offers a companion command-line application called FAB, leveraging similar metadata extraction techniques to generate lists of authors or producers from pre-downloaded files. The information extraction algorithms employed by CeWL and FAB contribute to the creation of effective wordlists for various security purposes.

CeWL, bundled with Kali Linux, simplifies word and phrase extraction from target web pages. This robust tool swiftly scrapes website web servers with ease.

To explore its full range of options and descriptions, launch the Kali Linux terminal and type “cewl -h”.

Default Procedure
Use the following command to generate a list of words that will spider the given URL to a specified depth and we can use it as a directory for cracking the passwords.

cewl http://www.vulnweb.com

Store this wordlist in a file
For record-keeping, efficiency, and readability, use the -w option to save the generated wordlist in a text file. This ensures easy access and organization of the collected data.

cewl http://www.vulnweb.com -w dict.txt

Retrieval of Emails from the website
To extract emails from the website, employ the -e option, while the -n option conceals the lists generated during the website crawl. As illustrated in the attached screenshot, it successfully identified one email address from the specified website.

cewl https://digi.ninja/contact.php -e -n

To count the number of words repeated on the website
If you want to count the number of times a word is repeated on a website, then use the -c option that will enable the count parameter.

cewl  http://www.vulnweb.com -c

Increase Spider depth
You can use -d option with the depth number to activate depth parameter for more quick and intense crawling so that a large list of words is created. The depth level is set to 2 as default.

cewl http://vulnweb.com -d 3

Verbose Mode
The inclusion of the -v option activates verbose mode, providing an extended output of website crawling results. This enables the retrieval of comprehensive details from the website during the crawling process.

cewl http://vulnweb.com -v

Alphanumeric Wordlist
Sometimes it may happen that you may need an alpha-numeric wordlist that you can use –the with-numbers option to get an alpha-numeric wordlist.

cewl http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php --with-numbers

Lowercase all parsed words
When you need the keywords to be generated in lowercase for that you can use the –lowercase option to generate the words in lowercase.
